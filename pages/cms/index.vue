<h2>Shipping Procedures</h2>
<h3>Shipping Confirmation Emails</h3>
<p>We will send you a shipping confirmation email when all or part of your order is shipped that will include the FedEx tracking number. You will be sent a shipping confirmation email with a tracking number for every shipment. You can also check the status of your order anytime by clicking on the Order Tracking link in the footer of every page on this site or by logging in to My Account and going to My Orders.</p>
<h3>Shipping in Multiple Packages</h3>
<p>If your order includes several items, they may ship separately and at different times. So that we can deliver your purchases to you as efficiently as possible, items which ship from the same location are grouped together. Our shipping confirmation emails will let you know how much of your order has shipped.</p>
<h3>Tracking Your Order</h3>
There are three easy ways to track your order:
<ul>
<li>Click on the Order Tracking link in the footer of each page. You will need your order number, billing last name and billing zip code.</li>
<li>Log in to My Account and go to the My Orders section. From there you will be able to choose which order you'd like to view and you will have an option to track the order.</li>
<li>You will receive a shipping confirmation email when all or part of your order is shipped. The email will include the FedEx tracking number.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Delivering Your Package</h3>
<ul>
<li>We process, ship, and deliver packages Monday through Friday. At this time, we do not offer shipping or delivery on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays.</li>
<li>Your order may be delayed if your shipping address is different from your billing address (we use this additional time to help ensure the security of your credit information).</li>
<li>Most items are available to ship in 1-2 business days unless otherwise noted.</li>
